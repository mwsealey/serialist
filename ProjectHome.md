Serialist is a helpful little system tray utility to list your serial ports under Windows and easily launch terminal programs or other utilities on those ports.

This is handy when you are developing with Arduino or other microcontrollers and have multiple COM ports that can be difficult to keep track of. Also you may wish to launch different terminal programs with different settings, or use programs such as LabView or Processing scripts to interface with your serial devices.
